# Online Portal System
The project entitled as “ONLINE PORTAL STSTEM” is developed using JSP Server as front end and MySQL as back end. The aim of the project is to provide an interface to school or college maintenance.

# Modules
1. Administrator module
2. Staff module
3. Student module
# System specification
# Hardware configuration
• SYSTEM PROCESSOR : Intel Pentium
• HARD DISK : 320 GB
• SYSTEM TYPE : 32-BIT operating system
• RAM : 2 GB

# Why Use JSP?
Java Server Pages often serve the same purpose as programs implemented using the
Common Gateway Interface (CGI). But JSP offers several advantages in comparison with
the CGI
• JSP are always compiled before they are processed by the server unlike CGI/Perl
which requires the server to load an interpreter and the target script each time the page
is requested.
• JavaServer Pages are built on top of the Java Servlets API, so like Servlets, JSP also
has access to all the powerful Enterprise Java APIs, including JDBC, JNDI, EJB,
JAXP, etc.

# Front End: JSP Server
Java Server Pages (JSP) is a server-side programming technology that enables the
creation of dynamic, platform-independent method for building Web-based applications. JSP
have access to the entire family of Java APIs, including the JDBC API to access enterprise
databases. This tutorial will teach you how to use Java Server Pages to develop your web
applications in simple and steps.

# Back End: MySQL
My S-Q-L officially, but also called /maɪ ˈsiːkwəl/ “My Sequel”) is (as of July 2013)
the world’s second most widely used relational database management system
(RDBMS) and most widely used open-source RDBMS.
The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms
of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary
agreements. 

# SYSTEM ANALYSIS
# Existing System
Current system is bit time consuming as they require some amount of work to be done prior for example creating an excel sheet which contains student information like marks,personal details or enter all these details manually.

# Proposed System
This is the tracking system which is used to keep track on the students overall academic performance and generate its report. In this system, a user can view the performance report . System can also compare each semester and user can see the comparative analysis report of the particular semester. In the proposed system, the staff can permit leave, add attendance details and the rest of the things will be done by the system which make it simple and fast.

# SYSTEM TESTING
    Software testing is the critical element of the software quality assurance and
represents the ultimate view of specialization, design and coding. The increasing availability
of the software as a system element and the attendant costs associated with a software failure
are motivating forces for well planned through testing.

# There are several strategies that are used in the system.
● Unit Testing
● Integration Testing
● Validation Testing
● Acceptance Testing

# CONCLUSION
The common problem faced by students these days is related to marks and
Attendance. Due to lack of coordination or inefficient system, handling of mark and leave
records becomes very difficult. With the help of the proposed system concerned faculties will
have proper information about student. It also helps those students who regularly attend the
classes but due manual system., they get marked as absent On the other hand most of the
students who are not attending classes usually get attendance because of the drawbacks of the
existing system.Thus, Students will not be able to cheat and this application helps to take
action against those students who usually are missing lectures. It will help students to analyze
their academic performance and can help to improve it. Faculties will also have relaxation
from the proposal as all hustling and bustling of maintaining records gets almost eliminated.
Overall, the efficiency of the proposal is incomparable and its effectiveness will bring an ease
to the life of studying students, parents and teachers.
